# Project reb0rex

Hi! This is my repo for the reb0rex project. This project is about making
my computer. As a developer and partially a gamer, I wanted to make a
computer that I could play on. I made this site to show the progress and
to also learn something about 3D graphics in modern browsers.

## Where to find it?

If the site is already (or still) running, you can find it at

```http
https://reb0rex.oxydien.dev
```

## How it was done?

This site was made using the Preact framework and Vite. The 3D graphics
were made by hand in Blender and then using GLTF 2.0 rendered in the
browser using threejs. Nothing too complicated.

## What can I do here?

Nothing really. This project was just for me as a learning experience
and to show of how I might use the computer.

Only reason why this repository is public is for other people to look at
how the site was made. The source code.

## Licensing

The code is free to use. Do whatever with it. (if not otherwise specified in
the respective dependency licenses)

The models on the other hand are made by me and are free to use as well,
under the condition that you credit me.

Fonts and other assets; you can find their licenses with the `.license` extension
